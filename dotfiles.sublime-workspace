Install [Package Control][]\n  2. Run `Package Control: Install Package` in the Command Palette (<kbd>Super+Shift+P</kbd>)\n  3. Install [Elm][] or use [NPM][] (`npm i -g elm`)\n  \n  ## Features\n  \n  - Compatible with [Sublime Text 2] and [Sublime Text 3]\n  - Syntax highlighting\n  - Snippets for common Elm syntax (function, `case` … `of`, `let` … `in`, etc.)\n  \n  | Tab Trigger    | Description                                      |\n  |----------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n  | cof            | ``case … of``                                    |\n  | cofm           | ``case … of (Maybe)``                            |\n  | cofr           | ``case … of (Result)``                           |\n  | fn             | ``Function (a -> b)``                            |\n  | fn2            | ``Function (a -> b -> c)``                       |\n  | fn3            | ``Function (a -> b -> c -> d)``                  |\n  | fn4            | ``Function (a -> b -> c -> d -> e)``             |\n  | imp            | ``import``                                       |\n  | impas          | ``import … as``                                  |\n  | let            | ``let … in …``                                   |\n  | mod            | ``module``                                       |\n  | type           | ``type``                                         |\n  | typea          | ``type alias (Record)``                          |\n  \n  - Autocompletions plus type signature and documentation display for all functions inside packages in your `elm-package.json` file (requires [elm-oracle](https://www.npmjs.com/package/elm-oracle), which you can install with `npm install -g elm-oracle`)\n      1. Bring up the type panel with `alt+up` or through the right-click context menu\n      2. Close the type panel with `alt+down`\n      3. If you don't like these keybindings, rebind them in your User packages directory\n  ![autocompletions screenshot](images/completions.png)![type signature screenshot](images/elm_types.png)![type panel screenshot](images/type_panel.png)\n  - Four standard build commands (<kbd>Super+[Shift]+B</kbd> or <kbd>Super+[Shift]+F7</kbd>)\n      1. `Build` just checks errors. Kudos to this [tweet][]!\n      2. `Run` additionally outputs your compiled program to an inferred path.\n      3. The same as the above two, but ignoring warnings\n      4. Output path is configurable in `elm-package.json` or `Elm Build System: …` in the Command Palette. Elm build system only requires a valid config in any ancestor directory of the active file. ![compile messages screenshot](images/elm_project.jpg)\n  - Compile messages\n      1. Navigate errors and warnings (<kbd>Super+[Shift]+F4</kbd>).\n      2. Formatted for build output panel.\n      3. Compile message highlighting, embedded code highlighting, and color scheme for output panel. ![compile messages screenshot](images/elm_make.jpg)\n  - Integration with popular plugins (installed separately)\n      1. [SublimeREPL][] — Run `elm-repl` in an editor tab with syntax highlighting. ![SublimeREPL screenshot](images/elm_repl.jpg)\n      2. [Highlight Build Errors][] — Does what it says on the box … usually.\n  - Integration with [elm format](https://github.com/avh4/elm-format)\n      1. Make sure `elm-format` is in your PATH\n      2. Run the \"Elm Language Support: Run elm-format\" command from the Command Palette to run elm-format on the current file\n      3. To enable automatic formatting on every save, Go to Preferences -> Package Settings -> Elm Language Support -> User and add this setting:\n          `\"elm_format_on_save\": true`\n      4. If there are certain Elm source files you don't want to automatically run `elm-format` on, for example elm-css based files, you can set a regex filter which will search the full filename (including the path to the file). If the regex matches, then it will not automatically run `elm-format` on the file when you save. For example, the following filter would prevent automatic `elm-format` on a file named `elm-css/src/Css/TopBar.elm`:\n          `\"elm_format_filename_filter\": \"elm-css/src/Css/.*\\\\.elm$\"`![elm-format screenshot](images/elm_format.png)\n  \n  ## Troubleshooting\n  \n  - I have `elm-oracle` installed, but completions, type signature display, and the type panel don't work\n      1. Make sure `elm-oracle` is on your PATH, or\n      2. Add the absolute path of the directory containing `elm-oracle` to the `elm_paths` setting in your Elm Language Support User settings\n  - I have `elm-format` installed, but it's not working\n      1. Make sure `elm-format` is on your PATH, or\n      2. If using an alternate name for the binary (`elm-format-0.17` or `elm-format-0.18`) add it to the `elm_format_binary` setting in your Elm Language Support User settings; an example might be `\"elm_format_binary\": \"elm-format-0.18\",`, or\n      3. Add the absolute path of the directory containing `elm-format` to the `elm_paths` setting in your Elm Language Support User settings. Note that you can combine paths with the above, so an example might be `\"elm_paths\": \"/users/alex/elm-format:/users/alex/elm-oracle\"`\n  - Elm format automatically runs every time I save a file, but there are some files I don't want it to run on\n      1. If there are certain Elm source files you don't want to automatically run `elm-format` on, for example elm-css based files, you can set a regex filter which will search the full filename (including the path to the file). If the regex matches, then it will not automatically run `elm-format` on the file when you save. For example, the following filter would prevent automatic `elm-format` on a file named `elm-css/src/Css/TopBar.elm`:\n          `\"elm_format_filename_filter\": \"elm-css/src/Css/.*\\\\.elm$\"`\n  \n  ## Learning\n  \n  Don't know Elm?

I hope this plugin helps you :)\n  \n  To Use\n  ======\n  \n  Visit the github page for a quick intro. [https://github.com/bollu/sublimeBookmark]\n  \n  Press Ctrl+P (or) Cmd+P depending on your OS.\n  Use _Add Bookmark_ to add a bookmark.\n  Use _Goto Bookmark_ to goto a bookmark\n  Use _Remove Bookmark_ to remove a bookmark\n  Use _Remove All Bookmarks_ to clear the list of bookmarks\n  \n  There are three modes to the plugin:\n  1) All bookmarks will be shown all the time - bookmarks will not be filtered based on the current project. For this mode, use the __Show All Bookmarks__ option.\n  \n  2)Only bookmarks of the current project will be shown - bookmarks belonging to other projects are *NOT* shown in this mode. Use the Use the __Show Bookmarks In Current Project__ for this mode.\n  \n  3) Only bookmarks in the current file is shown - irrespective of project. Use the __Show Bookmarks In Current File__ option for this mode.\n  \n  I hope you enjoy using the plugin as much as I enjoyed writing it :)\n  \n  Thanks again!\n  ~(bollu)[https://github.com/bollu/]\n\n\nGitGutter\n---------\n\n  Thanks for installing Git Gutter!!!\n  \n  👣 Follow me: @jisaacks\n  \n  \n  💛 Git Gutter?
