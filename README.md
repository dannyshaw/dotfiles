# dotfiles

My dotfiles.

Uses a schema of anything ending in '.link' will have a symlink created in $HOME
ie, `./vim/vim.link` will get a symlink pointing to it at `~/.vim`

borrowed from kody.js

## installation

`./bin/install.sh`

or individually run setup scripts in `./bin`

## Fork and Modify

Tweak away!
