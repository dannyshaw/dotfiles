# dotfiles

My dotfiles.

Makes use of [kody](https://github.com/jh3y/kody) as an installation tool to handle symlinking and some basic node powered scripting.  Kody was mainly used on OSX so I've added some linux specific install options.

## Usage

running `bin/getnode` will install Node Version Manager and Node 6.2.1. 


Install kody:
`npm install kody -g`

Now just run `kody` in the root and you will be presented with options.

## Fork and Modify

Tweak away! See docs at [kody](https://github.com/jh3y/kody)
